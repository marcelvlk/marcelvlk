# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi there! My name is Marcel Vlk and I'm thrilled you're here.

I'm on a mission to **build, lead, and grow** — not just in code, but in mindset. With a background in **Economics** and years of hands-on experience in **finance and investments**, I've developed a deep appreciation for systems, strategy, and smart decision-making. Now, I bring that same analytical edge and strategic thinking to the world of **software development**, **DevOps**, **cloud engineering**, and **AI**.

## 🚀 My Focus
- **Software Development** – Clean code, scalable systems, and meaningful solutions.
- **DevOps & Cloud** – Automating workflows, deploying confidently, and building resilient architectures.
- **Artificial Intelligence** – Exploring how intelligent systems can augment human potential.
- **Tech & Business Synergy** – Marrying my financial background with cutting-edge technology to solve real-world problems.

## 💡 What Drives Me
I believe growth happens at the intersection of curiosity and discipline. Whether it's mastering a new tool, optimizing cloud infrastructure, or experimenting with AI models, I thrive on learning fast and sharing what I know. Leadership for me means lifting others as I climb and building communities where people feel empowered to grow.

## 📈 Let’s Connect
If you're passionate about tech, business, or just building something great — I’d love to collaborate, learn from you, or even just have a good conversation.

**Let’s innovate. Let’s automate. Let’s lead the future of tech.**
